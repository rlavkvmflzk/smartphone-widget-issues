# Smartphone Widget - Feedback & Issue Tracker

Welcome to the **Smartphone Widget** module!

This is the official public repository for submitting bug reports and feature suggestions.

Your feedback is invaluable for improving the module.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Please Read Before Posting

You are welcome to submit bugs and suggestions, but please keep the following in mind:

* **This is a Wishlist, Not a Guaranteed Roadmap.**
    Submitting a feature here means it is on the list for consideration. It is *not* a promise that it will be built.

* **Priorities are Flexible.**
    I will prioritize issues based on severity, technical feasibility, and overall user impact. A critical bug fix may take precedence over a new feature.

* **Features May Change or Be Canceled.**
    An idea might be technically challenging or conflict with Foundry's core functions. I reserve the right to modify or cancel suggested features at any time based on development realities.

### üêû Reporting a Bug

1.  **Search First:** Check if your bug has already been reported.
2.  **New Issue:** Use the `Bug Report` template.
3.  **Be Detailed (Required):** To investigate and fix the bug, I need specific details. Without this information, it is very difficult to resolve the issue.

* Foundry VTT Version: (e.g., V11 Build 315, V12 Build 327)
* Game System (and Version): (e.g., dnd5e 3.0.0, shadowrun 6e 0.10.0)
* Other Active Modules: (Either the full list or at least any modules related to UI, time, or chat.)
* Exact Steps to Reproduce (Most Important!): Please list the specific steps from start to finish that cause the bug to happen.
* Context: (e.g., "This happens as a GM," "Occurs when a player opens the Settings app," "Happens immediately after sending a message," etc.)

### ‚ú® Suggesting a Feature

1.  **Search First:** See if your idea has already been suggested.
2.  **New Issue:** Use the `Feature Request` template.
3.  **Be Clear:** Explain what the feature is and *why* it would be useful.

Thank you for your support and for helping improve the Smartphone Widget!
