## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Please Read Before Posting

You are welcome to submit bugs and suggestions, but please keep the following in mind:

* **This is a Wishlist, Not a Guaranteed Roadmap.**
    Submitting a feature here means it is on the list for consideration. It is *not* a promise that it will be built.

* **Priorities are Flexible.**
    I will prioritize issues based on severity, technical feasibility, and overall user impact. A critical bug fix may take precedence over a new feature.

* **Features May Change or Be Canceled.**
    An idea might be technically challenging or conflict with Foundry's core functions. I reserve the right to modify or cancel suggested features at any time based on development realities.
