# Smartphone Widget - Feedback & Issue Tracker

Welcome to the **Smartphone Widget** module!

This is the official public repository for submitting bug reports and feature suggestions.

Your feedback is invaluable for improving the module.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Please Read Before Posting

You are welcome to submit bugs and suggestions, but please keep the following in mind:

* **This is a Wishlist, Not a Guaranteed Roadmap.**
    Submitting a feature here means it is on the list for consideration. It is *not* a promise that it will be built.

* **Priorities are Flexible.**
    I will prioritize issues based on severity, technical feasibility, and overall user impact. A critical bug fix may take precedence over a new feature.

* **Features May Change or Be Canceled.**
    An idea might be technically challenging or conflict with Foundry's core functions. I reserve the right to modify or cancel suggested features at any time based on development realities.

### üêû Reporting a Bug

1.  **Search First:** Check if your bug has already been reported.
2.  **New Issue:** Use the `Bug Report` template.
3.  **Be Detailed (Required):** To investigate and fix the bug, I need specific details. Without this information, it is very difficult to resolve the issue.

* Foundry VTT Version: (e.g., V11 Build 315, V12 Build 327)
* Game System (and Version): (e.g., dnd5e 3.0.0, shadowrun 6e 0.10.0)
* Other Active Modules: (Either the full list or at least any modules related to UI, time, or chat.)
* Exact Steps to Reproduce (Most Important!): Please list the specific steps from start to finish that cause the bug to happen.
* Context: (e.g., "This happens as a GM," "Occurs when a player opens the Settings app," "Happens immediately after sending a message," etc.)

### ‚ú® Suggesting a Feature

Have a great idea? We're excited to hear it! To help us keep track of all the wonderful suggestions, please follow these simple steps:

1.  **Search First:** Please take a moment to see if someone else has already suggested the same idea. This helps avoid duplicates and keeps the tracker clean.
2.  **New Issue:** If your idea is new, please use the Feature Request template. This helps organize the details.
3.  **Be Clear:** We'd love to know what the feature is and why you think it would be useful. The more detail you can provide (like how you imagine it working), the better!

Thank you for your support and for helping improve the Smartphone Widget!
