  "notes": "Update: Cinematic Cut-ins v1.1.6\n\n✨ New Features\n- Advanced Formula Trigger: Added a new trigger type that allows for detailed condition settings using custom logic (e.g., d[0] == d[1]). This enables full support for systems with unique critical hit rules or specific dice combinations.\n- Text Support in Variations: You can now specify separate Main/Sub text for each image variation. This allows for context-specific messages (e.g., displaying \"NICE!\" for a normal hit variation and \"PERFECT!\" for a critical hit variation).\n- Resource Trigger Modes: Resource triggers are no longer limited to dropping below a value. Added a \"Mode\" selection to support Increase (Above threshold) conditions.\n\n🐛 Bug Fixes\n- Voting Sound Sync: Fixed an issue where the participation confirmation sound during All-Out Attack voting was not playing correctly for other players.\n- Ghost Triggers: Fixed a bug where deleting the last trigger rule would cause it to reappear.",
