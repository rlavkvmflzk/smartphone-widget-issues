  "notes": "Update: Cinematic Cut-ins v1.1.5\n\n✨ New Features\n- Midi-QOL Integration: Added dedicated global triggers (On Attack, On Damage, On Critical) for D&D 5e actors. These options appear only when Midi-QOL is active.\n- Global Style Triggers: Triggers can now be saved in Global Styles. When importing to an Actor, you can choose to Style Only, Append, or Replace triggers.\n- Enhanced Analysis: Expanded text detection scope to include item names and merged content for better keyword recognition.\n- Monk's Common Display Support: Fixed compatibility issues where the overlay was hidden in spectator mode.\n\n🐛 Bug Fixes\n- Playback Duplication: Fixed a critical issue where cut-ins triggered multiple times due to user permission conflicts (Resources, Combat, Chat).",
